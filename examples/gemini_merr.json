    "final_summary": "Let's begin by dissecting the facial expressions. The initial peak at 2.88 seconds reveals a fleeting hint of anger and contempt. This suggests a negative emotional response, albeit a subtle one. The subsequent facial expression analysis at 3.48 seconds provides more detail. The cheek raiser, though present, is relatively weak, suggesting a less intense experience of joy or amusement. The lid tightener, with a higher intensity, indicates a more significant emotional response, often associated with both positive and negative emotions, such as intense focus, fear, or even suppressed anger. The upper lip raiser, also with a high intensity, is a key indicator of contempt or disgust, especially when combined with other negative cues. The lip corner puller, a smile, is present, but its intensity is moderate, suggesting a less genuine or perhaps a masked expression of happiness. The dimpler, also present, supports the smile, but again, the intensity is not overwhelming. The lips parting, with a high intensity, can indicate surprise, excitement, or even stress.\n\nNow, let's consider the audio clues. The speaker's tone is described as exasperated and slightly annoyed. The phrase \"我哪知道啊？ 我也没有这方面的经验\" (\"How would I know? I don't have experience in this area either\") further supports this. The speaker is expressing a lack of knowledge and perhaps a degree of frustration at being asked a question he cannot answer. The medium pitch suggests a controlled emotional state, not one of extreme excitement or distress.\n\nThe visual context provides additional information. The man is in a medical setting, wearing a white coat and a stethoscope. This suggests he is a medical professional. The presence of a television screen and shelves indicates an office environment. The fact that he is smiling while speaking is somewhat incongruent with the other clues. The smile could be a social mask, a way of appearing friendly despite feeling otherwise. The Chinese text at the bottom of the image is irrelevant to the emotional analysis.\n\nThe video content overview reinforces the setting and the presence of two men. The man facing the camera is the subject of our analysis.\n\nThe apparent contradiction lies in the smile versus the hints of anger, contempt, and exasperation. The smile, given the context and the other facial cues, is likely a social smile, a way of maintaining a professional demeanor. The lid tightener and upper lip raiser, combined with the exasperated tone, suggest that the man is experiencing a negative emotion, possibly frustration or annoyance, which he is attempting to conceal or downplay. The lack of experience mentioned in the audio further supports the idea that he is uncomfortable with the topic or question.\n\nIn conclusion, the core emotional state is frustration, and the most likely cause is being asked a question he cannot answer, likely related to his lack of experience in the specific area."
