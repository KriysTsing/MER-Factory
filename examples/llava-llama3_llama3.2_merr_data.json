    "final_summary": "**Part 1: Emotional Narrative**\n\nThe subject's emotional journey begins with a slight peak in contempt at 4.44s, which may indicate some initial frustration or annoyance. However, this emotion quickly shifts to a slight feeling of sadness and anger at 5.40s, suggesting that the subject is experiencing some form of disappointment or frustration.\n\nAt 6.36s, the subject experiences a brief moment of surprise, which could be related to an unexpected development in their situation. This surprise is followed by another peak in contempt at 7.04s, indicating that the subject may still be feeling frustrated or annoyed.\n\nThroughout this emotional journey, there are consistencies and contradictions between modalities. For example, the facial expression peaks at 5.40s show a mix of emotions, including an outer brow raiser (intensity: 0.91), brow lowerer (intensity: 2.82), upper lid raiser (intensity: 0.97), nose wrinkler (intensity: 0.93), and lip tightener (intensity: 0.84). These facial expressions suggest that the subject is feeling a mix of emotions, including frustration, disappointment, and possibly even anger.\n\n**Part 2: Overall Assessment**\n\nThe subject's overall emotional state appears to be one of \"Joyful Excitement\" at the peak moment in the video recording (5.40s). This inference is grounded in the subtitles, which explicitly state \"I got the job!\" and the audio tone, which shows a noticeable rise in vocal pitch.\n\nThe likely cause for this emotional state is receiving a long-awaited job offer, as suggested by the subtitles. The visual context of the image also supports this inference, with the subject standing in front of a window that offers a view of a cityscape, suggesting a sense of possibility and new beginnings."
